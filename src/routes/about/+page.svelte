				I'm a front-end developer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional user
				interfaces. I love to learn new things within web development. I have experience with HTML,
				CSS, JavaScript, React, Svelte, and Three.js. I'm always looking for new challenges and
				opportunities to grow as a developer. In my free time, I enjoy reading books, coding,
				painting/drawing/creative projects, working out, and spending time with my family and
				friends.
